This example demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling during asynchronous network operations. The initial code lacks comprehensive error handling, potentially causing the application to crash. The improved solution includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions, providing a more robust and user-friendly experience.  The solution also showcases how to gracefully handle HTTP status codes other than 200.  This example highlights the importance of proper error handling for building reliable Dart applications.
